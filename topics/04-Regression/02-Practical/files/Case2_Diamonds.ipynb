    "Unlike [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), Python is a general-purpose language and does not have built-in features for data mining, machine learning etc. Instead, Python library developers took the core features of R (which is open source) and reimplemented them so that they can be used as function calls in Python. One of the main libraries they developed was [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) which provides many of the same data-handling functionality of R, notably dataframes, lists, arrays, etc., with very similarly semantics to their R equivalents. This library needs to be imported first, and is given an alias `pd` for convenience."

    "This table summarises the results of fitting this particular model to the data. It can be seen as having 4 sections, as follows:\n",
    "1. The problem as posed to statsmodels. The `y` variable is referred to as the \"dependent variable\" (`price`). The model we are fitting is Ordinary Least Squares`OLS`) with the `Method` being Least Squares. The number of rows in `X` is referred to as the `No. Observations`. The number of degrees of freedom in the residuals $epsilon$ is 46, because it is calculated as the tnumber of observations (48) - the number of terms in the model (2: the slope and intercept of the line). Recall the diagram in the lecture notes where there was a grey 'space' spanned by the 2 model parameters and a given $y$ value which lay outside that space.\n",
    "2. On the right hand side of this group you can see some metrics about the _overall_ fit. The F-statistic is a traditional measure of model performance - large values of the statisic, and small values of its probability are considered better. The are very encouraging here: $10^{-40}$  is effectively zero, meaning  the chances of the data happening by accident and not being generated by a model like this one are effectively zero too. The R-squared and adjusted R squared represent the ratio of the overall variance in the data that is explained by the model. Generally, anything above 0.9 is considered pretty good, so this value is very good. So it is often consiered a good idea to choose the model with the highest R-squared value. However, that can be misleading, because the \"better\" model (with the higher R-squared value) might overfit the data. Although they are less well-known, the _Akaike Information Criterion_ (`AIC`) and _Bayesian Information Criterion_ (`BIC`) are much better metrics to use, because they take account of the fact that models with more terms reduce the degrees of freedom and are more likely to overfit the training data, at the espense of leaving enough degrees of freedom to apply to test data. Generally, _lower_  values of AIC and BIC are considered better than larger values. Therefore, given a set of models, it is worth choosing the model with the _smallest_ value of AIC or BIC.\n",
    "3. Th next table applies to the fitted paramneters $\\beta$ (the slope and intercept of the line). The slope is referred to as `carats` here because that was the name of the feature we used in the model. A t-statistic is computed for each model parameter.  The most interesting feature is that its probability is so small in each case (effectively zero), suggesting that the chance that the true value of the model parameter is zero is effectively negligible. We can also see this from the fact that the confidence interval for each parameter does not include zero. The fact the fitted intercept is not zero might be surpriiong, because it suggests, for this data, that when the weight of the diamond is zero, the owner owes money! This is an artefact of the fact that it probably does not make sense to extrapolate this data down to very small diamonds. They might have their own relationship between weight and price. Extrapolation is generally  considered risk, because we are predicting values in regions of the features where we did not have any training data.\n",
    "4. The next block is a set of metrics relating to how well the data and model meet the underlying assumptions for linear regression. For example, we can check whether the skewness is approximately zero (i.e., the residuals are symmetric around zero) and that kurtosis (peakiness) of the observed residual distribution is close to the value of a normal distribution (3). They appear close enough in this case; the Jarque-Bera test is a test of normality based on skewness and kurtosis and looks good here. The Durbin-Watson statistic is a check on the sequence of residuals to see whether they show _serial correlation_ (which would be unwelcome), because it suggests there is something going on in the background like: the value of the next residual can be predicted from the value of the residual before it. This is not the case here, and the Durbin-Wason takes a value very near its expected value of 2, as required. So we know from these etrics that the residuals are close to being normal, and there is no evidence of serial correlation. Lastly,  the condition number is relatively small. This metric increases as the degree of independence between the features decreases. Typically condition numbers of $10^6$ and greater might be cause for concern. There is no concern here. Overall everything looks good for theis model-data combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly, such model summaries can be compared between models. We will see this when comparing model1 (without) and model2 (with) the `quality` feature."

    "Compared to the R-squared value of the simpler model, which was already acceptable, it has improved even more when the `quality` feature was added. This means that model2 explains more of the variability in the data than model1. But has this come at the expense of overfitting that data? The evidence from the reduced values of `AIC` and `BIC` are that it has not: model2 is better than model because its `AIC` and `BIC` values are better (smaller). Of course we also need to check other metrics, some of which have disimporved. For example the kurtosis value is not as good (we recall from the two distribution plots that this is apparent there too) but it does not seem to matter. This shows that it is sometimes possible to improve a model by adding a term, but without seeing an improvement across all metrics. Therefore, it is always advisable to supplement any such analysis with visualisation (as done above) and also to to use techniques like cross-validation to look for evidence of over- and under-fitting."
